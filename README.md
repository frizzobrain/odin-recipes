# odin-recipes
my first top project about recipes

i can create a web pages and fill it with content (links, imgs,lists)
i can use links (absolute and relative links)
i can write a basic README file even if it's boring, i'm tired and i don't have time to do it cause my wife is waiting for me downstairs.
